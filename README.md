# Monogatari Song Sorter

__This is based off of another project. If you'd like to make your own sorter, please see [this repository](https://github.com/execfera/charasort).__

This is a web-based project that allows users to run a merge sort on Monogatari Series songs. It's completely client side and allows for various ways to share your results. To run your own, just clone or download the repository and launch the `index.html`.

I'm also working on a more convenient way to make your own sorter with Node that will be added to this repo but be seperate from the song sorter.
